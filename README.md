# Markov Chain Sentence Generator


Accepts a string of file object and then uses words from those objects to generate random sentences. 


Goal: make the sentences seem like they make sense even when they don't.

New concepts learned:
   - list, forward_list, vector, desque
   - std::cout << '\r'  (I'm going to be using this a lot)
   - rand (still need some more work on understanding)
   - Math models in coding.


v1.0: 
   - Ability to read from file.
   - Generates random sentences
